    This is my first Java App
    that I decided to develop myself without copy pasting from any other projects.
    Just using OCA and OCP Java SE 8, Head First books for java.

This is simple console Java App. You can use it after:

    in Quiz class change fields SOURCE_FILE and GAMERS_FILE with files pathes to yours

    write your questions to file in resources/questions.txt.

In file use pattern: Each line is a context for creating Question class object, that has values for each object's fields - and they separate by ':'. First in line is question, then right answer, then explanation and the rest are variants of answers that separates by '~'.

Example: question?:answer:explanation:1_answerVariant2_answerVariant3_answerVariant

Also all new user gamers are added to file as list of gamers with their name and score.
